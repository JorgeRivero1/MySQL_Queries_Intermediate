## Apple Product Counts


We‚Äôre analyzing user data to understand how popular Apple devices are among users who have performed at least one event on the platform. Specifically, we want to measure this popularity across different languages. Count the number of distinct users using Apple devices ‚Äîlimited to "macbook pro", "iphone 5s", and "ipad air" ‚Äî and compare it to the total number of users per language.

Present the results with the language, the number of Apple users, and the total number of users for each language. Finally, sort the results so that languages with the highest total user count appear first.

## Titanic Survivors and Non-Survivors

Make a report showing the number of survivors and non-survivors by passenger class. Classes are categorized based on the pclass value as:

‚Ä¢	First class: pclass = 1

‚Ä¢	Second class: pclass = 2

‚Ä¢	Third class: pclass = 3

Output the number of survivors and non-survivors by each class.

## Highest Target Under Manager

Identify the employee(s) working under manager manager_id=13 who have achieved the highest target. Return each such employee‚Äôs first name alongside the target value.

## Premium vs Freemium


Find the total number of downloads for paying and non-paying users by date. Include only records where non-paying customers have more downloads than paying customers. The output should be sorted by earliest date first and contain 3 columns date, non-paying downloads, paying downloads.

## Number of Streets Per Zip Code

Count the number of unique street names for each postal code in the business dataset. Use only the first word of the street name, case insensitive (e.g., "FOLSOM" and "Folsom" are the same). If the structure is reversed (e.g., "Pier 39" and "39 Pier"), count them as the same street. Output the results with postal codes, ordered by the number of streets (descending) and postal code (ascending).

## Election Results

The election is conducted in a city and everyone can vote for one or more candidates, or choose not to vote at all. Each person has 1 vote so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across these candidates. For example, if a person votes for 2 candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of 0.5 vote each. Some voters have chosen not to vote, which explains the blank entries in the dataset.

Find out who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the candidate or multiple names in case of a tie.

To avoid issues with a floating-point error you can round the number of votes received by a candidate to 3 decimal places.


| Columna  | Tipo de dato |
|----------|--------------|
| candidate| varchar      |
| voter    | varchar      |



 ```sql
with cte1 as (
    SELECT voter, COUNT(candidate) as n_votos
    FROM voting_results
    WHERE candidate <> ''
    GROUP BY voter
),
cte2 as (
    SELECT vr.voter, vr.candidate, ROUND(1 / cte1.n_votos, 3) as valor_voto
    FROM voting_results vr
    JOIN cte1 on cte1.voter = vr.voter
    WHERE candidate <> ''
),
cte3 as (
    SELECT candidate, sum(valor_voto) as valor_voto_total
    FROM cte2
    GROUP BY candidate
)

SELECT candidate
FROM cte3
ORDER BY valor_voto_total DESC
LIMIT 1


 ```

## Flags per Video

For each video, find how many unique users flagged it. A unique user can be identified using the combination of their first name and last name. Do not consider rows in which there is no flag ID.

| Columna        | Tipo de dato |
|----------------|--------------|
| flag_id        | text         |
| user_firstname | text         |
| user_lastname  | text         |
| video_id       | text         |



 ```sql
WITH cte as(
    SELECT *, CONCAT(COALESCE(user_firstname,''),  ' ', COALESCE(user_lastname, '')) as nombre_completo
    FROM user_flags
    WHERE flag_id is not null
)


SELECT video_id, count(DISTINCT nombre_completo)
FROM cte
GROUP BY video_id

 ```
